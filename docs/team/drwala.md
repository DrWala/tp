## Project: SunRez

SunRez is a resident management system for use in hostels and residential colleges (RCs). The user interacts with it
using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 19 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to manage rooms (CRUD Rooms)
  * What it does: Allows the user to manage the rooms of the hostel/RC.
  * Justification: This feature is a core feature of SunRez, which allows for the user to CRUD rooms. Without rooms, 
    there would be no hostel to manage. 
  * Highlights: This feature is a core part of SunRez. Significant effort went into the creation of the models, 
    commmands (`oadd`, `oedit`, `odel`, `olist`, `ofind`) and supporting structures (read/write from storage, tests) to 
    ensure that it integrates well with the existing infrastructure. There was also some challenge in dealing with enum 
    values for RoomType to ensure that they are displayed in a user friendly manner but can also be easily added.
  * Challenges: Due to the dependency on with rooms and issues, I had to think of a clean way to ensure that rooms
    can be edited while having issues/being allocated, but the room number should not be changed. Similarly, I had to 
    ensure that rooms which are allocated or have issues should not be deleted. I worked with Colin and Ian to ensure
    this was smoothly implemented.

* **New Feature**: Worked with Colin to design and plan the development of the Resident-Room allocation feature. There 
  were various alternative implementations and I assisted in working through each possibility to arrive at the one we
  decided to use.

* **Code contributed**:

* **Project management**:
  * Managed bug triaging, allocation, and fix timelines after PE-D
  * Managed team pacing, priorities, and deadlines for release `v1.4` 
  * Managed release `v1.4` on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated how command parsing deals with invalid inputs (especially relating to invalid `INDEX`) to present clearer 
    messages to the user. [\#330](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-1/tp/pull/330)
      * This was challenging as it was cross-command, and required a heavy refactoring of the AB-3 implementation
        of `Parser`'s interaction with all commands that use the `INDEX`.
  * Wrote additional tests for command parsing to support the change

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for all the room features: `oadd`, `oedit`, `olist`, `ofind` and `odel`: 
      [\#150](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-1/tp/pull/150), 
      [\#289](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-1/tp/pull/289) 
    * Created a section to explain how command parsing works, how parameter values are processed, and how errors are 
      handled:

* **Team tasks**:
  * Assisted in planning and implementation of forking workflow, including the norms the group will agree to
  * Assisted members in using Intellij to manage and resolve merge conflicts
  * Set up system of reviewing PRs within the team to enable a faster PR response time
    * Team members would now PM 2 people to review the PRs instead of waiting for PRs to be reviewed, increasing
      PR turnaround time
  * Set up [user stories](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-1/tp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Adrwala+as+a) and 
    [tasks](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-T14-1/tp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+author%3Adrwala+implement) for the team 
    in various sprints
